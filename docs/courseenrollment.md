## How do I register for a course?

After finding the course which interests you, enroll yourself by clicking 
on the `ENROLL NOW` button. Quantra offers both free and paid courses.

you are enrolled for the course, you can click on the `START COURSE` button

## How do I register for a paid course?

For a Paid Course, while enrolling yourself for the course, you will be 
redirected to a secure payment gateway where your payment will be 
processed. Once the payment is captured by the payment gateway, it will 
redirect you back to the course so you can start with the course right
away! In case of any issues with payment please write to 
us at [quantra@quantinsti.com](quantra@quantinsti.com).

finish your course you can access all the videos, quizzes, exercises and 
downloads for as many times as you want.

## What is the difference between mini track & full learning track?

Mini track on Quantra is a subset of a learning track, and it contains desired topic
specific courses. As opposed to a learning track which contains courses from `Foundation`
level to `Advanced` level, mini track contains less courses and can be purchased at a lower cost.

!!! example "For example"
    A `Mini Track` of Machine Learning contains [Python for Trading](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/course/python-for-trading), [Trading with Machine Learning: Regression](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/course/trading-with-machine-learning-regression), 
    & [Trading with Machine Learning: Classification and SVM](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/course/trading-machine-learning-classification-svm) courses. 

    However, a `Learning Track` of Machine Learning contains ==four== more courses (in addition to the courses in the mini track) namely [Introduction to Machine Learning for Trading](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/course/introduction-to-machine-learning-for-trading), 
    [Decision Trees in Trading](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/course/decision-trees-analysis-trading-ernest-chan), [Unsupervised Learning in Trading](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/course/unsupervised-learning-trading) & [Neural Networks in Trading](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/course/neural-networks-deep-learning-trading-ernest-chan).

## Can I try a paid course without buying it?

Yes, you can ==preview a course== before purchasing it on Quantra. To preview any course, simply click on 
the green `Free Preview` button (reference image added below) on the course page.
