## My payment got debited but I am unable to see my courses in the dashboard.

In such a case, you can follow the steps below:

1. ==Wait for a few minutes==, if you have just made the payment. You 
should mostly receive a payment confirmation email along with the course 
details.
2. Else, you can ==reach out to the Customer Success team== at 
[quantra@quantinsti.com](quantra@quantinsti.com) with the necessary 
screenshots & details of the enrolled course(s).

## I am unable to find my purchased course in the dashboard. What should I do?

In such a case, firstly, you should ==confirm if the payment== for the course was
successful. Post confirmation, if you're still unable to see the course in 
your dashboard, you can simply ==write to us at [quantra@quantinsti.com](quantra@quantinsti.com)== 
and our Customer Satisfaction Team will address your query at the earliest.
