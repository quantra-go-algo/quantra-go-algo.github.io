## What are course reviews? How do I review a course?

Once you have completed a course, you will be given the choice to share 
your review. This would help Quantra in enhancing the course and will 
also assist future students to understand more about the course from a 
fellow student’s perspective.

To give a review, you can follow the steps below:

1. Complete the course you have enrolled in
2. Click on the `Thumbs Up` :fontawesome-solid-thumbs-up: icon on the header of the learning portal
3. Once you have drafted the review, click on the `Submit` button to share the review with us

!!! Note
    In case you're unable to see the `Thumbs Up` icon, it might be possible that you have
    ==not completed the course== yet.

    However, if you're sure that you've completed the course and still can't submit your review,
    then please feel free to reach out to our team at [quantra@quantinsti.com](quantra@quantinsti.com). We will 
    make sure that we help you at the earliest.
