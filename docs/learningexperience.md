## What is the Dashboard?

Once you have logged into Quantra, you are directed to your personalized 
dashboard. On the dashboard, you will see the courses you have registered 
for, a link to the community of Quantra students and experts, notifications 
about your activity and upcoming events.

## How do I get my doubts cleared on a particular topic?

Quantraâ€™s `Community` is the best place to get your doubts cleared. You 
could first see whether the topic that you would like to discuss upon is 
already being discussed. If not, you can start a new discussion by clicking 
on the `Start Discussion` button. The community is where students and experts 
come together to discuss topics on Algorithmic trading, spending time here
will greatly help in clearing your doubts.

## Where can I find details about Quantra courses?

On your dashboard, clicking on the `Browse Courses` link will take you to the 
Course List page where you will find all the courses that are running on 
Quantra. Upon scrolling, there are filters on the right side of this page which would help you in 
filtering down to relevant courses. ==Clicking on a course== will show you more 
details about the course.

## How do I navigate through a course?

When doing a course, the ==top left side== of your screen will display the name
of the current unit that you are undergoing and a dropdown which contains 
the course structure. You can further click on any module of the course to 
expand and show its units. This is a useful tool to help you navigate to 
any unit in the course. Once you have finished a particular unit, clicking 
on the `NEXT` button will take you to the next unit in the course. 
Alternatively, you can also use the dropdown to navigate back and forth in 
the course.

## Do courses have captions or transcripts?

Yes! All courses on Quantra have the optional subtitles playing inside the video. 
All video units also have interactive subtitles running in the `Subtitle` tab below 
the video area. These subtitles are clickable, and can be used to navigate to any 
part of the video.

## Are videos downloadable?

No, videos are not downloadable on Quantra. However, some of the course 
material is downloadable such as ==Python Jupyter notebooks== (with strategy 
codes). We also guide you to use these codes on your own system for you 
to practice further.

## What are the system requirements to do a course on Quantra?

Fast-speed internet connection and a browser application is required for 
a Quantra course. For the best learning experience, use Google Chrome.
