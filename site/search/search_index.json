This is useful if our strategy (or some part of it) is executed at pre-determined time interval. A typical example will be weekly or monthly portfolio rebalance or a daily end-of-day square-off for an intraday strategy. For such cases, we can use the schedule_function API function, instead of checking for the time condition in handle_data ourselves. Scheduling function Call to schedule_function must be done at the initialize function. Also, make sure they are scheduled before at least 2 minutes from the close of the markets, else they might get triggered next day (to avoid potential forward-looking bias). We recommend scheduling time at least 5 minutes before day close. Examples below: from blueshift.api import schedule_function , date_rules , time_rules def initialize ( context ): schedule_function ( my_func , date_rules . month_start (), time_rules . market_open ( hours = 1 , minutes = 5 ))) def my_func ( context , data ): pass Here we schedule a function called my_func in the initialize function. The periodicity is specified by specifying the date periodicity and the time periodicity, date_rules and time_rules respectively. Here we use the month_start method of date_rule . The offset can be specified too. For example to run a function 5 th of every month, we can specify date_rules.month_start with a offset of 5 . Similarly, the time rules (via time_rules ) specifies the the function to be called after 1 hour and 5 minutes after the market_open . Note hours and minutes denote after for market_open and before for market_close . Other possiblities are: Date rules \u00b6 date_rules.every_day() : call every day date_rules.month_start(offset) : Call offset days after start of the month. date_rules.month_end(offset) : Call offset days before end of the month. date_rules.week_start(offset) : Call offset days after start of the week. date_rules.week_end(offset) : Call offset days before end of the week. Time rules \u00b6 time_rules.every_minute() : call every minute on the scheduled date time_rules.market_open(hours, minutes) : call hours and minutes after the market opens on scheduled date time_rules.market_close(hours, minutes) : call hours and minutes before the market cloes on scheduled date On the live platform you also can use time_rules.every_nth_minute(n) for a call every n-th minute and time_rules.every_nth_hour(n) for calls every n-th hour. For more details on the scheduling APIs, see the API doc . Scheduling in live runs \u00b6 Call time on live trading In live trading you should not make any assumption on the call timing of any functions - either scheduled or the main entry-point functions. However, the call orders will be maintained. The concept of time is different between backtest and a live run. In a backtest, we control the time, as we feed the time-stamps to the simulation engine. On a live run, we have no control. A function scheduled to be called at exactly 18:00 hours can be called later, if other routines part of the algorithm were busy executing as it waits in the line. This is particularly important if you are using the schedule_function API function to carry out end-of-day squaring off of positions in an intraday strategy. Make sure the timing of the scheduling is comfortably before the market close, so that it has a chance to run while the market is still trading.","title":"Contact Us"},{"location":"contactus/#scheduling-regular-actions-on-blueshift","text":"","title":"Scheduling regular actions on Blueshift\u00ae"},{"location":"contactus/#scheduling-functions","text":"On Blueshift\u00ae, we can schedule a particular function to be called at a particular time interval.

As opposed to a learning track which contains courses from Foundation level to Advanced level, mini track contains less courses and can be purchased at a lower cost. For example A Mini Track of Machine Learning contains Python for Trading , Trading with Machine Learning: Regression , & Trading with Machine Learning: Classification and SVM courses. However, a Learning Track of Machine Learning contains four more courses (in addition to the courses in the mini track) namely Introduction to Machine Learning for Trading , Decision Trees in Trading , Unsupervised Learning in Trading & Neural Networks in Trading .","title":"What is the difference between mini track &amp; full learning track?"},{"location":"courseenrollment/#can-i-try-a-paid-course-without-buying-it","text":"Yes, you can preview a course before purchasing it on Quantra.

For a start, see quickstart . You use Python to write the algorithm code. If you need a brush-up on Python basics see the tutorials section. I can't code, do you have any alternative? Yes of course, check out our visual programming Do I need to be expert in Python to write an algo? Not expert, but you do need basic familiarity to get started. See our tutorials section for a crash course on Python. We are also working on a feature release where you can entirely avoid coding to build strategies! Can I use R or MATLAB\u00ae to code my strategies? We support only Python at present. If you are familiar either R or MATLAB\u00ae, it is easy to pick up Python. Where can I learn Python for coding algorithms? See our tutorials section for a crash course on Python. What are the Python packages that I can use on your platform? We have a white-list of packages that you can use in your code (by simply import -ing them). How to develop algorithms with multiple code files? Checkout our help section on using the workspace . How to import my own functions from another file? Checkout our help section on using the workspace . The code editor (IDE) looks unfamiliar, how to use it? We use the Monaco editor that powers VS Code . If you are familiar with it that should help, including many of the key-board shortcuts . I am new to all this, where do I get ideas to develop strategies? Ideas are the most valuable input to the strategy development cycle. If you have prior experience in trading, try to express your trading rules in terms of clear mathematical formulae. You can look at the tutorials to get some ideas. Also check-out the primer on quant strategies page under tutorials to get some pointers to get started. Debugging algorithm code \u00b6 Do you have any tools to debug my code? At present, unfortunately, no. This is in our to-do list. How do I debug my code? At present, unfortunately, we have no support for any debugging tools. Also as a security measure, we have quite a few Python introspection functions (like type , dir etc.) either disabled or restricted. The working solution is a judicious use of the print statement. Quote \"The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements.\" Brian Kernighan, \"Unix for Beginners\" (1979) if you continue to have an issue you cannot resolve, please click the button that automatically comes up every time your code encounters an error during development (in quick backtest run). Why do I get a 'Symbol XXX was not found' error? This is usually because your code refers to an asset symbol , which is not in the dataset you used to run the strategy. Make sure you pick the correct dataset for the assets you are using. Why do I get a 'Use of type function on this object is not supported' error? We have disabled or restricted certain Python introspection . Usually, this should not affect a regular strategy code development. If it does bother you, give us a shout , with some details. Why do I get a 'illegal code' error? This means we detected some aspects of your code as potentially \"unsafe\".In most circumstances it is usually right, but false positives are possible. Reach out to us with your issues. We will be happy to help. Why do I get a 'No minute data for sid' error? This is usually because a frequency mismatch. You are using a daily dataset and referring minute-level data from within your strategy. Or you are referring to a benchmark asset (like SPY or NIFTY50 ), which only have daily data history. Why do I get a 'History window extends before ...' error? This is usually because in your code you are requesting data beyond the start date of the dataset you are using. Try setting the start date of your backtest to a later date. Alternatively you can catch this exception in the usual Pythonic way within your code. Why do I get an 'illegal str conversion' error? same us illegal code issue above. Why do I get a 'illegal import' error? same us illegal code issue above. You are trying to import a module outside our white-list.
